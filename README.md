🧠 NeuroSketch – AI-Powered Hand Drawing Analysis Tool
NeuroSketch is an intelligent web-based application designed to assess neurological conditions like Parkinson’s Disease by analyzing a user’s hand-drawn spiral sketches. The tool offers a simple and accessible way for patients, researchers, and healthcare professionals to perform digital drawing tests and monitor fine motor control patterns.

🚀 Features
✍️ Spiral Drawing Test Interface
Users can draw spirals or patterns directly on the canvas using a mouse or touchscreen.

📊 Real-Time Performance Metrics
Measures drawing speed, time taken, stroke smoothness, and deviation from standard patterns.

🧮 Average Score Calculation
Calculates an overall motor performance score based on accuracy and consistency.

🧠 Neurological Indicator Analysis
Helps in early identification of potential motor control issues, aiding Parkinson's screening.

📤 Data Storage (Optional)
Connects with Firebase or local storage for recording results (customizable).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas API, Bootstrap)

Backend (optional): Firebase / Flask / Node.js

AI Model Integration (optional): Teachable Machine / TensorFlow.js

Deployment: GitHub Pages / Firebase Hosting / Vercel

🎯 Use Case
Patients: Can self-test and share results with doctors.

Researchers: Collect and analyze motor control data at scale.

Healthcare Professionals: Use as a supportive tool for diagnosis and therapy monitoring.

📌 Future Scope
Add multi-test support (e.g., tapping test, reaction test).

Connect with voice analysis for holistic neurological screening.

Integrate AI-based pattern recognition for advanced diagnostic suggestions.
